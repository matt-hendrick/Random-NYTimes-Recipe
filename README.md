# Random NYTimes Recipe

[random-nytimes-recipe.web.app](https://random-nytimes-recipe.web.app/) is a TypeScript/Angular webapp that generates links to a random New York Times Cooking recipe. The webapp allows either clicking on a button that redirects the user to a random cooking recipe or clicking on a button that generates a list of 5 random recipe links.

This repo includes the Golang scraper that was used to scrape the +20,000 recipe URLs listed by the [NYTimes Cooking sitesmaps](https://www.nytimes.com/sitemaps/new/cooking.xml.gz).

This is a simple project I wrote in a couple days because I wanted a means of randomizing my cooking/recipe selection.
